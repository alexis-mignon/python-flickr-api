Python Flickr API
-----------------

As complete as possible implementation of Flickr API.

The project provides an almost exhaustive access to the Flickr API, through an *object oriented* Python interface.

The project is still at an early stage and requires a lot of testing.
Any help including bug reports is appreciated.

Main features
-------------
  *  Object Oriented implementation
  *  (Almost) comprehensive implementation
  *  uses OAuth for authentication
  *  context sensitive objects (depending on the query context, objects may exhibit different attributes)
  *  An interface for direct seamless calls to the Flickr API.
  *  A (django-complient) caching mechanism

Requires
--------
	* python >= 2.6.5 
	* python-oauth (or the python module from http://code.google.com/p/oauth/)
